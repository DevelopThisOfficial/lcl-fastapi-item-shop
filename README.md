# Let's Code Live: FastAPI

## Purpose

This repository is intended to show a very basic API backend which utilized Jinja template responses to host a "front end". This is not intended to be a fully fledged application!

## Folder Structure

The first thing we want to do is set up the application folder structure. This is important as we will be defininig where the templates repository is in this section. With this being a **very simple** example application, our folder structure will be very simple.

```bash
.
├── README.md
├── main.py
├── src
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── app.py
│   └── templates
│       ├── base.html
│       └── index.html
└── static
    ├── css
    │   └── custom.css
    └── js
```
